# Automatic Sudoku detection and Solving

This code automaticly detects sudokus in news papers, extracts and then solves them. In order to solve them, numbers are recognized through number recognition process. Once all information is gathered, a recursive backtracking algorithm solves the sudoku and then the solved sudoku is saved and displayed.
